# Dotfiles

A repository for my dotfiles that are managed by
[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). My neovim configuration can be found
[here](https://github.com/lcroberts/config.nvim).

Once you've installed chezmoi the dotfiles can be loaded with the following command:

```bash
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:lcroberts/dotfiles.git
```

Updating can be done with:

```bash
chezmoi update
```
